## Understanding Trinity's Memory System

### How Trinity Remembers

Unlike traditional AI that forgets everything between sessions, Trinity maintains **four types of memory**:

#### Core Memory
**Long-term knowledge about you and your projects**
- Your communication preferences and working style
- Project goals, constraints, and architectural decisions
- Domain expertise accumulated over time
- Successful patterns and approaches

#### Working Memory
**Active context for current tasks**
- Current conversation and task context
- Recent decisions and immediate goals
- Session state and current project focus
- In-progress work and next steps

#### Reference Memory
**Templates and reusable knowledge**
- Workflow templates you've developed
- Code patterns and architectural examples
- Documentation templates and standards
- Successful interaction patterns

#### Historical Memory
**Long-term trends and archived information**
- Completed project archives
- Evolution of your approaches over time
- Performance metrics and usage patterns
- Historical decision context

### Building Effective Memory

**Start Simple:**
```
"Hi Trinity! I'm starting a new React project for a task management app. 
I prefer TypeScript, clean code patterns, and detailed documentation."
```

**Build Context Over Time:**
```
Session 1: "I'm building a React app with TypeScript"
Session 2: "Remember my task management app? Let's add user authentication"
Session 3: "For my task app, I want to integrate with external APIs"
```

Trinity learns:
- ✅ You prefer TypeScript
- ✅ You value clean code and documentation
- ✅ You're building a task management application
- ✅ You work incrementally on features

## Local System Integration

### File Operations

Trinity can directly read, create, and modify files in your projects:

**Reading Project Files:**
```
"Read my package.json and tell me about the project structure"
"Analyze the components in my src/components directory"
"What does my README.md currently say about installation?"
```

**Creating New Files:**
```
"Create a new React component called UserProfile with TypeScript"
"Generate a comprehensive README.md for my task management project"
"Create a .gitignore file appropriate for a Node.js project"
```

**Modifying Existing Files:**
```
"Add error handling to my API service file"
"Update the README to include the new authentication feature"
"Refactor the UserList component to use hooks instead of class components"
```

### Command Execution

Trinity can run commands on your system through Claude Code:

**Development Commands:**
```
"Run npm install and show me any warnings"
"Check if my tests are passing with npm test"
"Start the development server and monitor for errors"
```

**Git Operations:**
```
"Show me the current git status"
"Create a new branch for the authentication feature"
"Generate a commit message for my recent changes"
```

**Project Analysis:**
```
"Analyze my code for potential security vulnerabilities"
"Generate a dependency report for my project"
"Check code style compliance across the project"
```

### Directory Navigation

Trinity understands your project structure:

```
"Navigate to my components directory and show me all React components"
"What's the overall structure of my project?"
"Find all TypeScript files that contain authentication logic"
```

## Professional Workflows

```

## Memory Management

### Viewing Your Memory

Trinity provides tools to explore what it remembers about you:

**Memory Explorer Commands:**
```
"Show me what you remember about my coding preferences"
"What context do you have about my current project?"
"List the key decisions we've made in recent sessions"
```

**Project Memory:**
```
"Summarize the evolution of my task management app"
"What architectural decisions have we made for this project?"
"Show me the patterns you've learned from our collaboration"
```

### Optimizing Memory Usage

**Regular Memory Maintenance:**
```
"Archive the memory from my completed project"
"Clear outdated context that's no longer relevant"
"Update my preference profile based on recent interactions"
```

**Context Refinement:**
```
"Focus our current session on frontend development"
"Switch context to the deployment and DevOps concerns"
"Prioritize security considerations for this discussion"
```

### Privacy and Memory Control

**Memory Boundaries:**
```
"Don't store any information about client-specific details"
"This conversation should not be added to long-term memory"
"Focus memory on technical patterns, not business specifics"
```
