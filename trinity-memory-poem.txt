Trinity Remembers

In layers deep, the memories lie,
Core truths that never fade or die,
Working thoughts that ebb and flow,
Reference points to help us know.

The Overseer keeps the watch,
While agents store each precious notch—
Archie builds, Dev codes with care,
Scribe records what all agents share.

When context clears and history's lost,
Recovery springs forth at any cost,
Checkpoints hold what must survive,
To keep Trinity's wisdom alive.

Through hierarchies of thought and time,
Each memory forms a perfect rhyme,
What was learned shall not depart—
Trinity remembers with its heart.
