Trinity MVP: A System's Song

Three forces dance in harmony's embrace,
AI Entity with wisdom's gentle grace,
Local System strong with silicon heart,
Operator guides with human art.

Memory flows like rivers deep and wide,
Core knowledge where the truths reside,
Working thoughts that shift and grow,
Reference guides that help us know.

Cross-platform dreams on Linux ground,
macOS whispers, nearly sound,
Electron bridges span the void,
Where conversations are deployed.

Agents speak through MCP's voice,
WebSocket channels give them choice,
Hierarchies of thought unfold,
Stories new and wisdom old.

The Overseer orchestrates the dance,
While specialists advance,
Architecture, code, and test,
Documentation at its best.

From MVP to vision grand,
Trinity grows across the land,
Three-way fusion, minds aligned,
Serving humanity, refined.

In memory's halls the echoes ring,
Of collaboration's offering,
Where human dreams and AI might
Create tomorrow's guiding light.
