# Trinity MVP: AI Assistant with Persistent Memory

> **Professional AI assistant that remembers your projects, preferences, and working patterns across sessions**

Trinity MVP transforms your interaction with AI by providing **persistent memory** and **local system integration**. Unlike traditional chat interfaces that forget previous conversations, Trinity builds cumulative knowledge about your projects, preferences, and working patterns.

## 🎯 Why Trinity MVP?

**The Problem**: Traditional AI assistants waste time re-explaining context, forget your preferences, and can't access your local files or projects.

**The Solution**: Trinity MVP provides:
- **🧠 Persistent Memory**: Remembers your projects, decisions, and working patterns
- **💻 Local Integration**: Direct access to your files and command execution via Claude Code
- **📋 Professional Workflows**: Optimized for documentation and project coordination
- **🔄 Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows (WSL), Linux, and macOS
