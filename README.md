## 🤝 AI Built With Integrity (No BS)

**Technology That Actually Respects You**

Most AI assistants are glorified chatbots that forget everything, can't touch your files, and treat you like a product. Trinity MVP is different: it's built with integrity to enhance your work without surveilling you.

**What Trinity Actually Does (No Marketing BS):**
- 🧠 **Genuine Memory**: Remembers conversations across sessions (stored locally on your machine)
- 📁 **Real File Integration**: Reads/writes your actual files directly - no copy-paste hell
- 🔐 **Honest Privacy**: Local conversation storage with transparent remote processing via Claude Code
- ⚡ **Practical Performance**: 4-6 second responses with persistent context that builds over time

**The Unvarnished Truth:**
- **Not "never leaves your machine"** - current requests go to Claude's API with smart context
- **Not "revolutionary AI research"** - it's thoughtful engineering that solves real problems
- **Not "thousands of users"** - we're building our first community of people who value integrity
- **Not "cutting-edge algorithms"** - practical file-based architecture that actually works

Your complete conversation history and memory patterns remain local - only the current request plus selected context is processed remotely.

- **Local Data Sovereignty**: Conversation history and memory patterns stored in ~/.trinity-mvp/
- **Transparent Processing**: Current requests + relevant context sent to Anthropic API via Claude Code
- **Intelligent Context**: Trinity optimizes what data is shared while maintaining conversation continuity
- **No Data Harvesting**: Your usage patterns and memory stay local; you're not the product
