# Trinity MVP: AI Assistant with Persistent Memory

> **Professional AI assistant that remembers your projects, preferences, and working patterns across sessions**

Trinity MVP transforms your interaction with AI by providing **persistent memory** and **local system integration**. Unlike traditional chat interfaces that forget previous conversations, Trinity builds cumulative knowledge about your projects, preferences, and working patterns.

## üé¨ Demo

*See Trinity MVP in action: persistent memory, local file integration, and professional workflows.*

**Key Demo Highlights:**
- üí¨ Natural conversation with memory retention
- üìÅ Direct file system access and editing  
- üîÑ Project context that persists across sessions
- ‚ö° 4-6 second response times with full local integration

## üéØ Why Trinity MVP?

**The Problem**: Traditional AI assistants waste time re-explaining context, forget your preferences, and can't access your local files or projects.

**The Solution**: Trinity MVP provides:
- **üß† Persistent Memory**: Remembers your projects, decisions, and working patterns
- **üíª Local Integration**: Direct access to your files and command execution via Claude Code
- **üìã Professional Workflows**: Optimized for documentation and project coordination
- **üñ•Ô∏è Native Support**: Optimized for Linux and macOS with native Claude Code integration
