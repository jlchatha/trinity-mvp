# Trinity MVP - Update Test Instructions

## For macOS Testers

Trinity MVP has been updated with a critical cross-platform fix! Here's how to test:

### Step 1: Update Trinity MVP
1. **Open Trinity MVP** (if not already open)
2. **Click the menu bar** â†’ **Trinity** â†’ **Check for Updates**
3. **Wait for update confirmation** (should say "Trinity MVP updated successfully!")
4. **Restart Trinity MVP** when prompted

### Step 2: Test Basic Functionality
1. **Type a simple message**: "Hello, can you say hi back?"
2. **Send the message** (click Send or press Enter)
3. **Wait for response** (should take 4-6 seconds)
4. **Expected result**: Trinity should respond with a proper greeting

### Step 3: Test Math Capability
1. **Type**: "What is 15 + 27?"
2. **Send the message**
3. **Expected result**: Trinity should respond with "42"

### Step 4: If Problems Occur
1. **Use Send Feedback**: Menu â†’ Trinity â†’ Send Feedback
2. **Include**: 
   - What you tried to do
   - What happened (or didn't happen)
   - Any error messages you saw

### What Was Fixed
- **Problem**: Trinity was using Windows-specific commands on macOS (causing undefined responses)
- **Solution**: Trinity now uses native Claude Code commands on all platforms
- **Result**: Trinity should work properly on macOS now!

### Expected Behavior After Fix
- **Response Time**: 4-6 seconds per message
- **Response Quality**: Intelligent, helpful responses from Trinity Assistant
- **Error Messages**: Should be rare - Trinity should work consistently
